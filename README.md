## Contributions
Designed and implemented the core FPGA system, including the SPI driver
for the FLIR Lepton camera, the real-time thermal image processing pipeline,
and centroid detection logic.

Additional project components were completed collaboratively as part of
a team MQP at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (2016).
